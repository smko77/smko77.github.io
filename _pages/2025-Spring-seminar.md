title: "Seminar on Prismatic Cohomology (Spring 2025)"
author_profile: true
---

The goal of this seminar is to give an introduction to prismatic cohomology, a p-adic cohomology theory developed by Bhatt and Scholze. We will mainly follow [Bha18] and [BS22]. 

We will begin by going through the basic theory of delta rings, and use this theory to develop prisms and the prismatic site. This will allow us to define prismatic cohomology. From here, we will explore various comparison theorems, including Hodge-Tate, crystalline and &eacute;tale. We hope to conclude with a more topological discussion of prismatic cohomology, particulary its relations to topological Hochschild homology (THH)

A more detailed plan of the seminar including topics for future talks and references can be found [here](/files/Learning_Seminar_Prismatic_Cohomology_Columbia.pdf). Please note that this document is still a work in progress.

## Talk List & Abstract
### Talk 1
* Title : Overview
* Abstract : We will watch a lecture given by Bhargav Bhatt at the IHES which introduces the motivation and general idea of prismatic cohomology. The lecture will importantly introduce some of the key players which will appear in later talks, such as the prismatic site, and give a rough idea of some of their features.

### Talk 2
* Title : Delta rings
* Abstract : TBA

### Talk 3
* Title : Distinguised elements and prisms
* Abstract : TBA

### Tlak 4
* Title : Perfect prisms and perfectoid rings
* Abstract : TBA

author_profile: true
---

The goal of this seminar is to give an introduction to prismatic cohomology, a p-adic cohomology theory developed by Bhatt and Scholze. We will mainly follow [Bha18] and [BS22]. 

We will begin by going through the basic theory of delta rings, and use this theory to develop prisms and the prismatic site. This will allow us to define prismatic cohomology. From here, we will explore various comparison theorems, including Hodge-Tate, crystalline and &eacute;tale. We hope to conclude with a more topological discussion of prismatic cohomology, particulary its relations to topological Hochschild homology (THH)

A more detailed plan of the seminar including topics for future talks and references can be found [here](/files/Learning_Seminar_Prismatic_Cohomology_Columbia.pdf). Please note that this document is still a work in progress.

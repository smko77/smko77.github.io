title: "Seminar on stable homotopy theory (Fall 2024)"
author_profile: true
---

The goal of this seminar is to introduce the notion of spectra and study its basic properties. We will discuss equivalence between spectra and generalized cohomology theories, the smash product of spectra, Spanier–Whitehead duality, Atiyah duality, the Steenrod algebra, the Atiyah–Hirzebruch and Adams spectral sequences, and the relationship between stable homotopy and bordism of smooth manifolds.

This seminar is intended for graduate student. The participants are encouraged to prepare and give a talk.

## Talk List & Abstract
### Talk 1
* Title : Spectra : definition and examples ([note](https://smko77.github.io/files/seminar_sh_week1.pdf))
* Abstract : In this talk, we will define spectra and Omega spectra and explain how generalized cohomology theories gives rise to Omega spectra via Brown representability. We will discuss some examples of spectra and its basic properties.

### Talk 2
* Title : The homotopy category of spectra
* Abstract : In this talk, we will define the homotopy category of spectra and discuss its stability properties. We will prove that suspension induces a self-equivalence of the stable homotopy category. We will define (co)fiber sequence of spectra and construct the associated long exact sequences. We will explain how the stable homotopy category forms a triangulated category.

### Talk 3
* Title : The smash prodcut
* Abstract : This talk introduces the smash product in spectra, which provides a symmetric monoidal structure on both the category of spectra and its homotopy category. We will disuss its key properties and the definition of ring and module spectra. If time permits, we will also cover the point-set level construction using symmetric spectra.

### Talk 4
* Title : Homology, Cohomology and products
* Abstract : I will define the homology and cohomology of spectra and show that they satisfy the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms along with other basic properties expected of homology theories. I will also briefly describe the external, internal, and slant products.

### Talk 5
* Title : Inverse limit, lim^1, and the Milnor exact sequence
* Abstract : We will define inverse limits in the context of abelian groups then explore its derived functor, namely its first derived functor lim^1. We then will define, and give a proof (sketch) of the Milnor exact sequence involving lim^1.

### Talk 6
* Title : Spanier-Whitehead duality and Atiyah duality
* Abstract : I will introduce Spanier-Whitehead duality for spectra and explain how it relates their homology and cohomology. I will also introduce Atiyah duality and outline a proof of Poincare duality using it.
